1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,551
We developed a technique called lattice engineering to address this

2
00:00:03,651 --> 00:00:07,475
problem and create usable ordered structures of Nitrogen Vacancy Centers

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,566
Since NV centers require higher energy the closer together they are,

4
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:17,440
we can apply a low energy light pulse

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,451
to the diamond to only excite defects

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,250
that are far away

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,998
from other defects,
